Flask is based on the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and Jinja2 template engine.
 Both are Pocco projects.

2)  Werkzeug
It is a WSGI toolkit, which implements
 requests, response objects, and other 
 utility functions. This enables building a web 
 framework on top of it. The Flask framework uses
 Werkzeug as one of its bases.



 3) Jinja2
Jinja2 is a popular templating engine for Python.
 A web templating system combines a template with a 
certain data source to render dynamic web pages.
